            The <b>Tibetan alphabet</b> is, as previously discussed, a script from the Brahmic family of scripts in
            Asia. Although considered
            an "alphabet", it does not function like the Latin alphabet: instead, it functions as an <b>abugida</b>, or
            <b>alphasyllabary</b>. This means that rather than encoding phonemes, like the Latin alphabet, or encoding
            concrete,
            distinct syllable sounds, like the Japanese <em>hiragana</em> and <em>katakana</em>, the Tibetan alphabet
            encodes
            consonant information as the primary unit, and vowel information as a secondary mark or indication.

        <p>
            Traditionally, each grapheme encodes a single syllable, with an unmodified grapheme marking a consonant
            plus the -a sound.
            Vowels are expressed as diacritical marks, either on the top or the bottom of the grapheme. Therefore, the
            character for the cosonant "k-" (ཀ) already encodes the syllable "ka", but can be modified into "ki" (ཀི),
            "ku" (ཀུ), "ke" (ཀེ), and "ko" (ཀོ).
        </p>

            Other modifiers exist as punctuation, such as a marker for the beginning of text (༄, known as "yig mgo" or
            ཡིག་མགོ་),
            a full stop for the end of a section (།, known as "tshig-grub" or ཚིག་གྲུབ་), another full stop for the end
            of a topic
            (༎, known as "don-tshan" or དོན་ཚན་), and an abstract morpheme delimiter<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> (་,
            known as "tseg" or ཙེག་).

        <p id="fn1"><sup>1</sup> Morphemes are the smallest concrete units of grammatical meaning. A morpheme
            delimiter, then,
            is a character that denotes seperate morphemes. This is comparable to a hyphenation scheme like
            "un-break-able" in English.</p>
