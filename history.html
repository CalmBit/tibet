            Tibetan, as a language, has no clear independent origin. The Tibetic language family is concretely defined
            as a set of dialects derived from Old Tibetan, the original and first written language of the Tibetan
            empire
            in the seventh sentury CE. Old Tibetan itself is known only from the literary history chronicled by the
            early Tibetan empire. The written form of Old Tibetan is commonly classified as being sourced from Indic
            script,
            namely the <b>Brahmic</b> family of abugidas, or alphasyllabaries.

            Takeuchi (2012) lays out a rough outline of the possible "former" stages in the lead-up to a formalized
            Tibetan
            orthography:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Initial exposures to Indic script and trials to write down Tibetan with the script</li>
            <li>Official establishment of the alphabet</li>
            <li>Establishment of the orthography</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Specifically, Takeuchi notes the lineage of the Tibetan abugida is specifically traceable to the <b>Siddhaṃ</b>
            script, also known as <b>Siddhamātṛkā</b>, used between the sixth and thirteenth century CE in India. The
            abguida,
            then, would have been more formally assigned to the phonology of what Takeuchi refers to as the "colloquial
            form
            [of Tibetan] spoken by the Tibet dynastic family" at the time (Takeuchi, 2012, p. 2).

        <p>
            As the Tibetan empire spread, so did the language - first, throughout the entire Tibetan plateau:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "Due to the rapid expansion of the Tibetan state, they spread over the whole Tibetan pleateau
            conquering and assimilating other ethnic groups. Toward the North and East to Amdo and Eastern Kham,
            they conquered the Sumpa and Nampa (or Thong-myi) peoples who probably spoke Tibeto-Burman languages,
            and the Bailan (Turkic), ‘Azha (Serbi-Mongolic). Expanding westward to Mnga’-ris, they conqured
            Zhangzhungs, another Tibeto-Burman language speaking people" (Takeuchi, 2012, p. 4).
        </blockquote>

            Then, through Central Asia:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            "The Tibetan state further expanded to Central Asia. Tibetan involvement of East Turkestan (Kashgar and
            Khotan) and West Turkestan (Wa hān) started as early as the 660s, finally giving the Tibetans control
            over a large part of the Tarim Basin in 670. But Tibetan control thereafter was not very stable. It was
            only around 790 when the Tibetan Empire firmly controlled the Southern part of the Tarim Basin and the
            Hexi (the Gansu Corridor)" (Takeuchi, 2012, p. 4).
        </blockquote>
        <p>
            Although the Tibetan empire dissolved during the middle of the ninth century, the Tibetan language was
            considered a <em>lingua franca</em>, or common/bridge language, between non-Tibetans such as the "Chinese,
            Khotanese and Uighurs until the 11th century" (Takeuchi, 2012, p. 4).
