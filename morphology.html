            Tibetan is an <b>Ergative–absolutive</b> language, as opposed to English (and most other Western
            languages), which are
            <b>Nominative–accusative</b>. The actual difference is somewhat difficult to explain, but in short it
            relates to the
            way that transitive and intransitive verbs relate to nouns as subjects and objects.</p>

        <p> In a <b>Nominative–accusative</b>
            language, like our own, the <em>Agent</em> of a verb clause (i.e. "I" in "I threw the ball") is marked the
            same as the
            the subject in any other clause (i.e. "I have arrived") but is distinct from the object (i.e. "He saw me"
            vs "He saw I").
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p>
            An <b>Ergative–absolutive</b> language reverses this dynamic. The subject of an intransitive verb is marked <em>differently</em>
            to the agent of a transitive verb, and instead shares its marking with the <em>object</em> of the transitive verb. This is hard
            to formalize into English, as our grammar doesn't necessarily support this.

            Hill (2013) divides the Tibetan copula (i.e. the verb "to be") into six, individual classes, divided
            by two particular qualities:

        <p>
            The <b>Existential</b> copula is used to denote that circumstances or physical things exist or are owned by
            the speaker,
            whilst the <b>Equational</b> copula is used to denote value or quality.
            <b>Personal</b> denotes the statement is in reference to a quality of the speaker. <b>Factual</b>, as the
            word implies,
            suggests a statement that is based in reality or firm knowledge. <b>Testimonial</b> denotes that the
            speaker was a <b>witness</b> to the facts at hand, and that it is only based on sensory knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Standard Tibetan verbal conjugation is based on this system of copulas, and according to Hill, is highly
            regular:
