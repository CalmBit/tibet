            The Tibetan language is a contentious topic in the area of Tibet's education, in no small part due to the
            influence of China on most bureaucratic affairs in the Tibet region. Postiglone (2005) explains a
            contemporary
            Tibetan primary cirriculum:
        </p>
        <blockquote>"Primary school children were taught Tibetan with some Chinese in the morning, followed by
            mathematics in the afternoon. Most children had school books in Tibetan script, except for the subject
            of Chinese language.The village schools teach Tibetan, Chinese and mathematics, but never get through
            the first volume of the Chinese reader. Before Tibet began to produce its own teaching materials, the
            schools used the “Five Province/Region Tibetan Teaching Materials” (wushengqu jiaocai) national
            standard
            school textbooks across a range of subjects that were translated from Chinese into Tibetan language"
            (Postiglone, 2005, p.10)</blockquote>
        <p>
            Although Tibetan schools do have a mandatory education in Tibetan, then, the influence of Chinese as a <em>lingua
                franca</em>
            for the entirety of China cannot be readily escaped.
